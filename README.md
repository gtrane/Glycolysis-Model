# Glycolysis-Model
This code involves a deterministic model of glycolysis, a biochemical reaction network. My worked included development and application of mathematical models of reaction networks using systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations; numerical techniques employed to study system stability and perform simulations in realistic biological contexts.

Code includes:
- import of numpy, matplotlib, and scipy
- differential ordinary equations
- visualizations of the 10 separate steps in glycolysis, including how concentrations of enzymes enzymes, rate constants, and other system parameters affect the cycle as a whole
